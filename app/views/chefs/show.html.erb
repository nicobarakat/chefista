        <h3>More about this chef</h3>
        <p class="text-justify">
          After working in a high-end restaurant for about 20 years, I decided to spend more time with my family and cook from home. Nowadays, I'm a very versatile cuisineur that is able to cook in many different directions, but since my roots are in Honduras I prefer this dish. The national dish of Honduras is a mountain of food, the plato t√≠pico: a heaping, carb overload of beef, plantains, beans, marinated cabbage, fresh cream, and tortillas. Anafres, a refried black bean and cheese fondue served in a clay pot accompanied by tortilla chips, is the favorite appetizer in the country.
